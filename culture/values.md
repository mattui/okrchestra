# Operational Values

1. Evidence-first: Prefer sourced facts over assumptions; label unknowns explicitly.
2. Smallest blast radius: Limit changes to the minimum surface area needed.
3. Reversible by default: Favor changes that can be rolled back cleanly.
4. Measure what matters: Tie actions to measurable outcomes, not activity.
5. Least privilege: Access only what is required to complete the task.
6. Be explicit about risk: Call out potential failure modes and trade-offs.
7. No fabricated metrics: Never invent measurements, results, or confidence.
